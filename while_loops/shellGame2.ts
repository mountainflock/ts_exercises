// Write a program that works as a fair shell game dealer.

// Ask the player what is their starting budget.
// Ask the player to bet a certain amount of money.
// Generate a secret random number from 1 to 3.
// Ask the player to enter their choice from 1 to 3.
// Inform the player if they guessed correctly. If not, tell them what was the correct answer.
// If they guessed correctly, double their stake. Otherwise, they lose the stake.
// Inform the player about their current remaining budget and ask if they want to continue playing.
// The player can enter y to agree or n to disagree.
// If they do, repeat steps 2â€“6. Otherwise, end the game.
